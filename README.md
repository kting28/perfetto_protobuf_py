# Introduction
These are perfetto protobuf definitions compiled for python. [Source](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/perfetto/protos/perfetto/) can be found here. Not fully working yet since the output file is not recognized by Perfetto UI. See the [synthetic track event guide](https://perfetto.dev/docs/reference/synthetic-track-event) for some documentation on creating these events.
